## Active Tasks
- [x] Change working project branding
- [ ] Finish rebasing the current settings system to XML
- [ ] Add support for the new DWM APIs present in higher editions of Windows
- [ ] When switching between some themes, the background root in the xml doesn't get parsed, causing the bug that the background color doesn't get applied in some themes and will only work after a restart
- [ ] Fully implement Tile Library
- [ ] Change the server where the tiles, themes, localization and updates are retrieved
- [ ] Implement the notification system. Some tiles/other apps can now show a notification whenever the Notification class is called
- [x] Revamp on the Settings UI and Tile Library
